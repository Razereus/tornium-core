Navigating Tornium
==================
There are four main sections to Tornium:
 * Faction
 * Discord Bot
 * Stat DB
 * Torn Data

There are also a few other sections such as "User Settings" and the API that you most likely won't use as frequently. These sections appear on the desktop on larger displays or the dropdown menu on smaller ones. As you navigate through Tornium's sections, you'll also see subsections for each section appear underneath the section list. There will also be a breadcrumb above the faction list to indicate your current location on Tornium.
